description: "Safarium is a public digital history project that allows visitors to identify and visualize historic journeys of the early modern period (14th-18th centuries) by searching locations and browsing items in a database of travel writing. The project's aim is to encourage transregional and comparative studies by enabling the discovery of complementary sources of disparate geographical and cultural origins. Safarium intends to foster community through collaboration and promote education through public history and the digital humanities."
