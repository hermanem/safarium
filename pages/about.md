## About Safarium

Safarium is the creation of Matthew Hermane, a PhD candidate in the Department of History at Indiana University Bloomington. Inspired by a dissertation project examining examples of French and Persian travel writing produced by embassies that nearly crossed paths in Siam during the winter of 1685-1686, Safarium endeavors to promote transregional historical studies that involve complementary sources written by authors of disparate cultures and geographies. By searching locations in Safarium's database, users can identify travel accounts across languages that comment on the queried locale. Users are also presented with maps reflecting the itineraries and routes in the travel accounts returned by the search results. Safarium strives to put users in touch with sources they may be unaware of due to research specialties or language limitations. Because the instances of travel writing produced by European printers alone during the early modern period number in the thousands, Safarium is a project in the fullest sense of the word. In the future, Safarium hopes to enable the contributions of volunteers employing various digital methods. Beyond research, Safarium intends to be a tool for familiarizing students and the public with both early modern history and the digital humanities.

This digital collection is built with [CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/), an open source framework for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that is developed by faculty librarians at the University of Idaho Library following the Lib-Static methodology.

This project uses the CollectionBuilder-CSV template and the static website generator Jekyll to create an engaging metadata-driven interface. CollectionBuilder-CSV is a "Stand Alone" template for creating digital collection with only a CSV of collection metadata and a folder of images, PDFs, audio, or video files. With collection metadata, the template generates engaging visualizations to browse and explore your objects. The resulting static site can be hosted on any basic web server. See [CB Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/) for detailed information.
